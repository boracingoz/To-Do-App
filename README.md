# Modern To-Do App (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This is a fully responsive, modern, and user-friendly **To-Do App** built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. The app supports user registration and login using `localStorage`, and allows each user to manage their own tasks independently.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a clean frontend architecture while practicing DOM manipulation, form validation, and basic client-side authentication.
